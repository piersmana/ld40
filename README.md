Go Team Cougar!

More soon.

## Deployment
Committing to the master branch automatically launches a build-deploy. Therefore, contributions should be developed in *feature branches* and merged in via pull requests that require sign-off by one other developer. This is all soft-enforced, so please don't break things :)
